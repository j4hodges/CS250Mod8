Module 8
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? 
By listening to the client and bringing the experience I have behind me. Asking questions cannot be overstated here. Clarification is vital if something is not fully understood.

How does creating “user stories” help with this?
User Stories give the details of what is needed, wanted, and expected. Somewhat in that order even. The stories prioritize items that have been listed and allows the items to be created in order of difficulty and need. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
I gather all of the data the deliverable will require. What is it that I do not know? Might seem like a silly quetion, but it is a common question I ask when I am begining a project that I am missing data on. Such as the Chada project. I changed approach as issues arose and embraced the chnages that came along so that I might be able to deliver the best deliverable I am able to.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Communication, self motivation, reliabiltiy. These three things cannot be overstated.
